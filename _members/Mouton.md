text: "My name is Lea Mouton, I am half a PhD student with Alain Vanderpoorten as main supervisor and half assistant to Nicolas Magain. In addition to organizing the logistics for the specialized master in conservation biology and biodiversity management, I support the students in their naturalistic journey and in their meetings with the various actors of the conservation of nature throughout their masterâ€™s. The aim of my PhD project is to assess the drivers and the patterns of land plants distribution in Macaronesia across taxa and scales. I also enjoy participating in side projects that include abroad fieldworks and epiphytic ferns, as a continuity of my master thesis."
