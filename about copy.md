## About me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/myface.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

<p> My name is Nicolas Magain. I am a postdoctoral associate in the Evolution and Conservation Biology Unit at the University of Li√®ge, which is part of the InBios Research Center and the Department of Biology, Ecology and Evolution (BEE).</p>
### My work
<div class="box">
  <p>
  I study the evolution of lichen symbioses, in particular between Peltigera fungi and Nostoc cyanobacteria. I use phylogenetics, metagenomics, population genomics and community ecology to study these symbioses.
  In paralle, I teach classes on Evolution, Biodiversity, Plant Systematics and Conservation Biology at the Bachelor and Master levels.
