## Research


<p> Research in the lab is articulated around two main axes: Evolution and Conservation Biology.

<div class="box">
  <p>
The first axis is centered around the evolution of lichen symbioses. We mostly (but not only) study the association between mycobionts of the genus Peltigera and photobionts of the genus Nostoc, using phylogenetics and genomics.
<br /> Our research tasks include:
<br />-Discovering and describing new lichen species
<br />-Studying specificity between mycobionts and photobionts from the ecological and evolutionary standpoints
<br />-Studying the microbiome of lichens
<br />-Studying genomic signature of nitrogen fixation by lichenized cyanobacteria</p>

  <p>
The second axis is centered around the conservation biology. This axis is intertwined with the conservation biology teaching activities at the University of Li√®ge, especially the specialized master in conservation biology and biodiversity management. </p>
