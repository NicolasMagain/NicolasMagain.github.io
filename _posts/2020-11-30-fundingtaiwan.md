## Funding for bilateral Taiwan-Belgium project with Ko Hsuan and colleagues!
<p>I am so happy that we got funding to collaborate with my long-time friend <a href="https://kohsuanchen.wixsite.com/fungi">Ko Hsuan Chen</a> (Academia Sinica, Taipei). Ko Hsuan and I overlapped in the Lutzoni lab at Duke for many years, and we had a long tradition of matching costumes for Halloween (see above).</p>
<p>More seriously, the MOST-FNRS bilateral funding will allow us to study the microbiome of mosses and lichens in Montane Cloud Forests in Taiwan. We are planning to start our sampling in October 2021.</p>
<p>Other participants to the project are Drs Alain Vanderpoorten (ULiège), <a href="http://romaindarnajoux.alwaysdata.net/">Romain Darnajoux</a> (Princeton U) and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jenpanhuang">Jen-Pan Huang</a> (Academia Sinica).</p>
<p>The project will also likely involve two graduate students from ULiège.</p>
<p>I am very excited to start (or continue) collaborating with such amazing scientists.</p>.
