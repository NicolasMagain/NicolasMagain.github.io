## Two publications about me on the University of Liège website and a radio interview
<p>On the University of Liège website were recently published two articles about me (in French).</p>
<p>One was part of a series of <a href="https://www.sciences.uliege.be/cms/c_6426034/fr/portrait-de-nicolas-magain" target="_blank">portraits about newly-appointed professors</a>.</p>
<p>The other one was part of a <a href="https://www.sciences.uliege.be/cms/c_7159445/en/facsc-rencontre-avec-un-alumni-nicolas-magain" target="_blank">series of interviews of alumni of the Sciences Faculty.</a></p>
<p>I was also invited to a <a href="https://www.rejouisciences.uliege.be/cms/c_14480726/fr/nuit-des-chercheur-es-2021" target="_blank">radio program on our research on biodiversity</a> for the "Nuit des chercheur.e.s" (Researchers night). My part starts after about 1 hour 15 minutes on the mixcloud.</p>
