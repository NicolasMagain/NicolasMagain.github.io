## Prix de l'Adjudant Hubert Lefebvre!
<p>I received the <a href="https://www.academieroyale.be/fr/actualites-detail/messages/laureats-prix-classe-sciences-decernes-2020/" target="_blank">Prize of Adjudant Hubert Lefebvre</a>, presented by the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium</p>
<p>Created in 1923, this prize awards an original work in botany. It rewards my work on fungal-cyanobacteria symbioses in lichens. </p>
<p>This is a very good way to end this very crazy year.</p>
