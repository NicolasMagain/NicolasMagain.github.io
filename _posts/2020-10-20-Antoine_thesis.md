## Antoine successfully defended his PhD thesis!
On October 19th, 2020, Antoine Simon successfully defended his PhD thesis entitled "The multi-organismal nature of lobarioid lichens: phylogenetic and transcriptomic studies on photomorphs" at the University of Liège (Belgium). The thesis is composed of 5 chapters (including 3 published articles) spanning from comparative transcriptomics and microbiome studies to taxonomic and phylogenetic revisions in the genera Sticta, Dendriscosticta and Emmanuelia. The jury was composed of E. Sérusiaux, N. Magain (advisors), B. Goffinet, T. Spribille, A. Vanderpoorten and D. Baurain. We wish good luck to Antoine in his future endeavours!
