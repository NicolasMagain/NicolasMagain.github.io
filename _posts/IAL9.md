## Talks from the lab
<p>On August 1-6, 2021 was held the 9th conference of the International Association for Lichenology (IAL).</p>
<p>The meeting was initially supposed to be held in Bonito, Brazil but eventually was full online due to COVID.</p>
<p>I gave a talk entitled "Eco-evolutionary dynamics of Nitrogen fixation by lichenized Nostoc revealed by metagenomics".</p>
<p>PhD student Elise Lebreton gave a talk on her master research entitled "AN ASSESSMENT OF CHANGES IN THE FOLIICOLOUS LICHEN
DIVERSITY OF GUADELOUPE SINCE THE 1960s".</p>
<p>Professor emeritus Emmanuël Sérusiaux gave a talk entitled "TESTING THE α-DIVERSITY OF LICHENIZED FUNGI: A CASE STUDY
WITH REUNION, A SMALL AND REMOTE ISLAND IN THE INDIAN OCEAN".</p>
<p>Former PhD student Antoine Simon gave a talk entitled "THE DUAL NATURE OF LICHENS: A TRANSCRIPTOMIC APPROACH TO
UNDERSTAND PHOTOMORPHISM" for which he got the best student talk award. Congrats!</p>
<p>Carlos Pardo De La Hoz (Lutzoni lab, Duke University) gave a talk on our collaborative research, entitled "Eco-evolutionary drivers of interaction turnover in the Peltigera/Nostoc symbiosis" as part of a symposium that I co-hosted with Dr. Garima Singh,  entitled "eco-evolutionary dynamics of the lichen symbiosis" and which also featured great talks by Manuela Dal Forno, Lucie Vancurova, Julieta Orlando and Hadi Nazem-Bokaee </p>
<p>The abstract book can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-oGQTkqcuCDFbHgaSDxc_6xTFISzgDvd/view" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>IAL is the largest conference about lichens, and is held every 4 years.</p>
<p>I will see if we can put the videos on the website.</p>
