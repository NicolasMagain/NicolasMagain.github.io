## Finally back to the field in Romania with students!
<p>From September 5 to 16, 2021, students of the conservation biology master went to the Romanian Carpathian mountains and Transylvania to discover its outstanding fauna and flora.</p>
<p>We talked about this hotspot of biodiversity and how traditional agriculture including late mowing by hand and extensive grazing led to it.</p>
<p>We also talked about coexisting with bears and wolves, met with farmers, and visited bogs and primary forests.</p>
