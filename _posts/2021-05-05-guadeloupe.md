## The "Parc National de la Guadeloupe" funds our project on foliicolous lichen
<p>As part of Elise Lebreton's thesis on the evolution and diversity of foliicolous lichens, the <a href="www.guadeloupe-parcnational.fr" target="_blank">Parc National de la Guadeloupe</a> decided to fund our field campaign there.</p>
<p>The field campaign should start in January 2022. We will collect foliicolous lichens with a special focus on Gomphillaceae and Strigulaceae.</p>
<p>Way to go Elise!</p>
