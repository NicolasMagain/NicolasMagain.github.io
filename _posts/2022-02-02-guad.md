<p>From January 18 to February 1st, as a research collaboration with the Parc National de Guadeloupe, Elise Lebreton (FRIA PhD Student), Nicolas Magain and Emmanuël Sérusiaux sampled lichens and leaves in Guadeloupe. </p>
<p>Lots of organisms grow on the surface of leaves in tropical forests, including lichens, fungi, algae and bryophytes.</p>
<p>The three main goals of the field trip were:</p>
<p>- A taxonomic and phylogenetic revision of Gomphillaceae and Strigulaceae in Guadeloupe.</p>
<p>- Characterizing green algae within and outside of lichens at the surface of leaves from an ecological point of view.</p>
<p>- A broader project of checklists of lichens from France's Overseas territories.</p>
<p> Even if recent sulphur emissions from the volcano seem to have harmed lichen communities, the field trip was a success, with many interesting specimens collected!</p>
<p> A lot of work for Elise in the lab now!</p>
<p> A slideshow of pictures from the field trip can be found on the <a	href="https://www.sciences.uliege.be/cms/c_8984836/fr/mission-de-recolte-en-guadeloupe" target="_blank">Website of the Faculté des Sciences</a></p>
